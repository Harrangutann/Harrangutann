# About Me

👋 Hello, I’m @iHarrrison, a Junior Software Engineer and a Final Year Computer Science student. I came into the industry via an IT Professional Apprenticeship in 2017,
working on a helpdesk and moving into software development after succesfully completing the course. I went part time at my place of work and began my uni course
in September 2021.

📙 I’m knowledgable in a range of languages; the main ones being Java, Javascript, Python and C#. My most recent project has been my final year product, which has been written in Python and integrates with Microsoft Azure. This can be found in my list of reposotories here on GitHub, and achieved me a grade of 83 for the dissertation project.

👨‍🦰 My personal interests are playing the bass guitar, reading books, playing games and keeping up-to-date with the tech industry.
