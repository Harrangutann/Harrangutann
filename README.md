# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @Harrangutann, an Automation Specialist with a passion for streamlining workflows through code. My primary language is Google Apps Script, but I also have a strong foundation in Java, JavaScript, Python, and C#.

ðŸš€ My journey into tech began with an IT Professional Apprenticeship in 2017, where I transitioned from helpdesk support to software development. This led me to pursue a Computer Science degree, graduating with First Class Honours.

ðŸ’¡ I'm going to try and get better at writing code outside of the workplace, but my proudest piece of software on my repo is the Groundskeeper Willie project. This was my final year project at university, where it achieved an 83.

ðŸŽ¸ Outside of coding, I enjoy playing the bass guitar, diving into a good book, gaming, and staying current with the latest tech innovations.
