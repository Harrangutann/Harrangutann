# About Me

👋 Hello, I’m @iHarrrison, a Junior Software Engineer and a 2nd year Computer Science student. I came into the industry via an IT Professional Apprenticeship in 2017,
working on a helpdesk and moving into software development after succesfully completing the course. I went part time at my place of work and began my uni course
in September 2021.

📙 I’m currently learning and writing in a range of languages; the main ones being Java, Javascript and C#. Most of my work thusfar has been in Java, working in React for an existing UI project and most recently a brand new project, including frontend and backend development. I have also recently worked in Terraform, creating an application that "cleans up" resources tagged for expiration.

👨‍🦰 My personal interests are playing the bass guitar, reading books, playing games and keeping up-to-date with the tech industry.
